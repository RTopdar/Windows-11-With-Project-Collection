# Windows 11 Clone Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a clone of Windows 11 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I initially got the idea from CodeWithHarry but that was a pretty simple and easy version that consisted mainly of screenshots and transitions.

But this is an advanced version that has clickable icons on the start menu and the taskbar, and both of them are responsive to wallpapers since the menu and taskbar have a glass-like design.



I got to learn about the project from CodeMite and made the project using a lot of his own code, but I made some improvements of my own.

1. The initial code of CodeMite had the date and time hardcoded. I added some JavaScript functions to make sure that the time shown in the taskbar is accurate and gets updated in realtime.

2. I made the search function in the start menu case-insensitive so that searching becomes easier

This project was only possible since those two videos were available and both CodeWithHarry and CodeMite made me understand those concepts a lot.
