# Windows 11 Clone Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This is a clone of Windows 11 using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I initially got the idea from CodeWithHarry but that was a pretty simple and easy version that consisted mainly of screenshots and transitions.

But this is an advanced version that has clickable icons on the start menu and the taskbar, and both of them are responsive to wallpapers since the menu and taskbar have a glass-like design.



I got to learn about the project from CodeMite and made the project using a lot of his own code, but I made some improvements of my own.

1: The initial code of CodeMite had the date and time hardcoded
